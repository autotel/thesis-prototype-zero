#all


default clock mode to incremental


remember either to connect pi direct to computer or bring a router to the stage,
I may need to access it via ssh


## moduleselector
* be selectable
* mute modules
* remove modules
## sequencer
- step division for slower patterns, default at 12 whilst clock default multiplier to 4*12
* mute channels, destinations or notes
## presetKit
- mute notes
- copy and paste
* octave
* auto fill functions: all grades in one channel,
* auto fill function: one channel per button,
* change channel of all presets, change destination of all presets

maybe the grade modifier is transparent for all except the grade,
so it becomes a "global harmonizator" kind of thing




## grade
* input obsolete
## general
* notes will stay forever when jogging
## clock (not urgent)
* start and stop clock or select and apply, because when selecting output it will mingle the time of all seqs
* be able to receive signals, specially to reset the drift
## new modules
would be nice some module to create harmonizations, maybe it takes the info from a sequencer,
and upon selected points in the sequence, it makes harmony on other channel from the seq harmony
## style
* homogenize module types
* perhaps remove lazy approach
* find that function to execute at the end that doesnt nest
