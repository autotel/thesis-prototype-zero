#Changes in the general logic
* create a table of header functions
* create the protocol of communication for whole kits
* Solution to the execution order paradox
* The note length management should be a feature of the note, or of each module? For instance, if a sequencer is connected to a harmonic mapper, and it triggers a note with length 8 steps, the note off should be generated by the sequencer and propagated, or should it be sent with it's length to the mapper, adn the mapper count the steps and generate the noteoff when reached? Perhaps the two things can be always possible?
* apply the new standard of eventmessages
* make the data communication to allow a sequencer to express itself through a presetkit
#Modify modules
## grade
remove
## chordKit / harmonic mapper
* rename it: it is a scale/grades mapper, not a kit of chords
* do not discard the channel info as it is currently doing
## presetKit
* use the same scheme that the scale mapper uses to avoud hanging notes
## clock
* start and stop clock or select and apply, because when selecting output it will mingle the time of all seqs
* be able to receive signals, specially to reset the drift
#Modules to create
* A router to route channels to outputs/ modules
* Performative sequencer or arpeggiator, something similar to what I saw once in a video..
* A sequencer that can have more than one simultaneous playhead
